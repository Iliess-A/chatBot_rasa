# chatBot_rasa
let's create a chat bot in python and Rasa

## first set up vsCode:

Here i am using Visual studio code, but i want to work in a virtual envirenement so let set it up( for wsl ), 

1. Open your project folder in VS Code.
2. Open the terminal in VS Code.
3. Create a virtual environment by running the following command in the terminal:
<< python3 -m venv myenv >>
//Replace myenv with the name you want for your virtual environment.
4. Activate the virtual environment:
<< source myenv/bin/activate >>

Select the Python interpreter for your virtual environment in VS Code:
Press Ctrl + Shift + P to open the Command Palette.
Type Python: Select Interpreter and choose the interpreter from your virtual environment.
Install necessary packages using pip within the activated virtual environment:
pip3 install package_name ( here we will be using Rasa ).

This setup will allow you to manage your projectâ€™s dependencies in an isolated environment.

!!! Don't forget to enter the isolated environement by doing in the bash command :
<< source myenv/bin/activate >>, now u can do the pip3 install.
ps: to get out of the isolated environement do: << deactivate >>

While installing and setting up ur environement u will need pip3 so don't forget to update it.

## Second rasa setUp:

When I tried installing rasa the first time I got a probleme cause I used pip install rasa instead of pip3 install rasa. ( error was about an old package or whatever ).

While installing u will get to choose where to install the package and if you want the bot to get train by the pre-training file and finaly if you want to speak with ur bot
in the terminal, you can try it but the bot won't be able to answear a lot of question it's just a try/test.( when ur finished just do crtl + C ).

It's should be all for the setup.

## third step :

Now we finally get to train our bot for what we want, but to do so we need to now for what u wanna train ur bot and get a lot of data the more the best to train it.

Here i am gonna train it for basic help in a web site so it should be able to answear customer question, redircet the customer to the right page and so on.
