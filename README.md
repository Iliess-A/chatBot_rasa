# chatBot_rasa
let's create a chat bot in python and Rasa

## first set up :

Here i am using Visual studio code, but i want to work in a virtual envirenement so let set it up( for wsl ), 

1. Open your project folder in VS Code.
2. Open the terminal in VS Code.
3. Create a virtual environment by running the following command in the terminal:
<< python3 -m venv myenv >>
//Replace myenv with the name you want for your virtual environment.
4. Activate the virtual environment:
<< source myenv/bin/activate >>

Select the Python interpreter for your virtual environment in VS Code:
Press Ctrl + Shift + P to open the Command Palette.
Type Python: Select Interpreter and choose the interpreter from your virtual environment.
Install necessary packages using pip within the activated virtual environment:
pip install package_name ( here we will be using Rasa ).

This setup will allow you to manage your projectâ€™s dependencies in an isolated environment.
